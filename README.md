This application is a timed code quiz that presents the user with a series of multiple-choice questions. The user's score is determined by the number of questions answered correctly and the amount of time remaining on the timer.

# Usage

To use this application, simply click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz. You will have a limited amount of time to answer all questions. If you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the clock. If you answer all questions correctly or the timer reaches 0, you will then be prompted to enter your initials to save your score.

The timer will turn red when it reaches 10 seconds to warn you that the time is running out.
